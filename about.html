          Business Plan and Final Pitch Judging Criteria
        </h1>
        <div class="content small judging">
          Your final pitch will be four minutes of presentation, followed by two minutes of questions from the judges.  The business plans should be 5 pages in length at most - they are more of an extended
           extended executive summary.  You can also submit one additional page on whatever you want.  Both the pitch and the business plan will be judged on the following four criteria:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Value Creation:</em> Has the team clearly identified a significant problem, and compellingly articulated a scalable solution to it?</li>
            <li><em>Value Capture:</em> Has the team persuasively articulated how it will earn revenue from the market's adoption of its solution?</li>
            <li><em>Credibility:</em> Will the team be able to leverage the prize money to succeed in their plan?</li>
            <li><em>Quality of Plan:</em> Has this team determined an appropriate, financially viable plan to successfully commercialize this product?</li>
          </ul>
          To score well in the above categories, we suggest your business plan try to include:
          <ul>
            <li>Strategy / Core strategic advantage</li>
            <li>Competitive landscape</li>
            <li>Business model</li>
            <li>Sales process for acquiring a customer</li>
            <li>Financials (e.g. what is your cost of customer acquisition, what is your break even point)</li>
            <li>Primary target market and add on markets (e.g. who is your customer?)</li>
            <li>Team information and background (the role each team member will play in the startup)</li>
            <li>Pricing</li>
            <li>Any evidence that people will buy what you're offering</li>
            <li>Prototype</li>
            <li>Minimum viable business product (what can you make fast that people will pay for?)</li>
            <li>Financing needs</li>
          </ul>

          Team Rules
        </h1>
        <div class="content small teams">
          <ol>
            <li>There is no fee for entry.</li>
            <li>Individuals or teams may submit ideas.</li>
            <li>Each team may enter one idea.</li>
            <li>Each team must contain at least one SUTD affiliate.  An SUTD
              affiliate is defined as a current SUTD student, an SUTD alumni,
              or an SUTD postdoc or researcher.</li>
            <li>SUTD students must submit their @mymail.sutd.edu.sg or
              @sutd.edu.sg email address in their submission.</li>
            <li>Required events must be attended by at least one SUTD affiliate from each team.</li>
            <li>Entries must be the original work of entrants.</li>
            <li>Teams must disclose any funding received at the time of submission.</li>
            <li>Teams must not have accepted any institutional funding for the
              idea being presented (i.e. the team cannot have sold equity to
              anyone outside of the team, including non-managing founders)</li>
            <li>Teams must not have accepted any non-institutional funding in
              excess of S$100,000. Non-institutional funding includes contests,
              grants, friends and family, bank loans, etc. where there is no
              equity ownership associated with the funding.</li>
            <li>Some forms of funding that fall into a gray area. In this case the
               SUTD 10K organizing committee will deliberate on eligibility and
               communicate a decision to the team. This decision on eligibility is
                final and cannot be appealed.</li>
            <li>The Judging Panel reserves the right to disqualify any entry based
               on the prior guidelines.</li>
